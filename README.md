## Assignment introduction

An introduction to our first attempt at navigating TypeScript (send help). And why not combine it with our first ever collaborative group assigment (hello code conflict) whilst exploring the world of TypeScript. Oh and whilst we are at it we might as well throw the concept of agile workflows into the mix.

What you see is a joint collaborative effort between five authors resulting in a minimalist quiz that serves its purpose. Unfortunately for all you non-Swedish speakers, you won't get to experience how little you actually know about real music.

## Technical requirements

- Create an array container with at least 20 questions.
- Generate a set of questions randomly from the question container array.
- Remove the selected question from the array to ensure that player is presented with unique questions even when playing new round.
- Display the selected question along with three answer options.
- Ensure that only one answer can be correct for each question.
- Accumulate and update the score for each correct answer.
- Implement a timer function that starts ticking upon starting the quiz.
- Reset the timer for each quiz round or when the player chooses the “New player” option.
- Conclude the quiz round after 10 questions are answered.
- Display the total time taken, the final score, and an option to re-take the quiz.
- If the player chooses to play another round, provide a different set of 10 questions.
- Reset the timer for the new round.
- Allow the player to select a "New Player" option which resets and re-shuffles the questions presented for player to see unique set of questions.

## Lessons Learned

General takeaways:

Throughout this project we have collectively and individiually acquired a lot of takeaways and lessons learned.

- We have learned how to navigate the world of GitHub, the importance of spending an adequate amount of time planning and structuring a project before venturing out into writing code.
- We have learnt how to implement agile workflows into group projects, the importance of communication and the ability to read and understand each others code. In hindsight we are also grateful that we all kept our cool throughout the process, which enabled us to truly embrace the project.

TypeScript specific takeaways:

- We have also appreciated the advantages of being able to use TypeScript to define variables, various types as well as interfaces to eliminate usererrors and programming errors, which has been beneficial especially in a group setting.
- It has also been benecifical to receive errormessages as you go, which reduces potential bugs further along the project.
- Furthemore it has been useful to find a mutual way of coding
